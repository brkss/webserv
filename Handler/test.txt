The new descriptor is set to remain open across execve system calls; see close(2) and fcntl(2).

     The system imposes a limit on the number of file descriptors that can be held open simultaneously by one process.

     A file's metadata can be updated even if the file was opened in read-only mode.  Getdtablesize(2) returns the current system limit.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, open() returns a non-negative integer, termed a file descriptor.  It returns -1 on failure, and sets errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The named file is opened unless:

     [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.

     [EACCES]           The required permissions (for reading and/or writing or search or executing) are denied for the given flags.

     [EACCES]           O_CREAT is specified, the file does not exist, and the directory in which it is to be created does not permit writing.

     [EACCES]           O_TRUNC is specified and write permission is denied.

     [EAGAIN]           path specifies the slave side of a locked pseudo-terminal device.

     [EDQUOT]           O_CREAT is specified, the file does not exist, and the directory in which the entry for the new file is being placed cannot be
                        extended because the user's quota of disk blocks on the file system containing the directory has been exhausted.

     [EDQUOT]           O_CREAT is specified, the file does not exist, and the user's quota of inodes on the file system on which the file is being created
                        has been exhausted.

     [EEXIST]           O_CREAT and O_EXCL are specified and the file exists.

     [EFAULT]           Path points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EINTR]            The open() operation is interrupted by a signal.

     [EINVAL]           The value of oflag is not valid.

     [EIO]              An I/O error occurs while making the directory entry or allocating the inode for O_CREAT.

     [EISDIR]           The named file is a directory, and the arguments specify that it is to be opened for writing.

     [EISDIR]           The named file is a directory, and the arguments specify that it is to be opened for executing.

     [ELOOP]            Too many symbolic links are encountered in translating the pathname.  This is taken to be indicative of a looping symbolic link.

     [EMFILE]           The process has already reached its limit for open file descriptors.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]     A component of a pathname exceeds {NAME_MAX} characters, or an entire path name exceeded {PATH_MAX} characters.

     [ENFILE]           The system file table is full.
